The difference betweet Streaming API and REST API

1. The streaming api is to get the twitter posted by user in real time, which means that the twitter you get is post in this moment. You can set some constrain condition using some parameters in the api and the api will return the twitter that satisfy your condition. However, the result return to you is after sampling by Twitter.
